Introduction
In this scenario, you are a project lead in an IT company. You and your team are working on a huge project, which consists of multiple functionalities and modules. This project is evolving over time and so your team is expecting a lot of code revisions. In this lab, you'll learn how to use a distributed version control system called Git. You'll also discover how to connect to a VM instance, install Git, and configure your Git user information. Next, you'll create a local Git repository, add a file to the repository, and do some basic operations like adding a file, editing files, and making commits.

What you'll do
Create a git repository.
Add files to this repository
Edit the files
Commit the changes to the repository.


Linux users: Connecting to your VM via SSH

chmod 600 ~/Downloads/qwikLABS-XXXXX.pem
ssh -i ~/Downloads/qwikLABS-XXXXX.pem username@External Ip Address
